A good first project is to write a blog, assuming you are a new developer the below project should be easy enough to get you going.

Create a new project, mvc and identity for logins and use razor to write the UI.

Getting Started

create a directory

in a terminal

dotnet new mvc --auth Individual

Basic spec:

Your site must have a home page that lists all the blog posts.

Your site must have a page to allow a logged in user to create a blog post.

Your site must have a page to allow a blog posts author to edit a blog post.

Only a blog posts author should be able to edit a blog post.

Only the author should be able to see the edit link

If anyone other the author attempts to access a posts edit page they must be redirected to a 403 page.

A blog post has these properties.

Id (int)

Author (user id, guid)

Title (string)

Content (string)

Created_date (datetimeoffset)

Last_updated date (nullable datetimeoffset)

When a user submits a blog post, the content must be validated and errors reported back to the user

A logged in user should be able to create a new blog post.

An anonymous user should only be able to read blog post.

That's it, its a very simple exercise as it covers tiny amounts of

Ui Logic

Data validation

DB persistence

Basic MVC routing

Give this a go, put it in a repo then post it here and ask for feedback. If you want the spec can be extended later on.
